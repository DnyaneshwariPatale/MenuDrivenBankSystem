## 🖋 About Project:
👉 An online banking system built using Python. This system allows the customer and banking staff/manager to manage all transactions easily. <br>
👉 The primary purpose of this system is to simulate customer’s transaction management for Bank to maintain the detail of each transaction/record.<br><br>
👉 There are 1 users for this system:
1. **Admin**
    - Can **create new Customer’s profile** and **provide them login id and password** to access the system.
2. **Customer**
    - Can **login to the system**.
    - Can **do the transactions** like Deposit, Withdrawal.
    - Can **view their own transactions**.

> Note: **Every user needs to sign in to access the system. All the data must be stored in text (.txt) files.**<br>

## 💻 System Design:
👉 In this online banking system, there are 9 different menus, namely:
1. **Main Menu**
2. **Admin**
    - Admin Login
    - Admin Menu
    - Admin New Profile
3. **Customer**
    - Customer Login
    - Customer Menu
    - Customer Deposit 
    - Customer Withdraw
    - Customer View

 <br><br>
👉 There is also a simple security verification in this system where the customer/admin is asked to enter a password and user id. <br>
👉 Suppose **the user id/password is not the same as the database (txt file)**, **the system will ask the user to enter the user id/password again until it is correct**.
